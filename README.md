# my-problem-solving-methodology
An effort and work in progress, to distill my approach to problem solving into repeatable written steps. It occurred to me, while helping fellow programmers create solutions to algorithmic problems; that I had unconsciously developed a way of thinking, favorable to defining and overcoming logical problems. This is an attempt to clarify and refine my own methodology and hopefully help someone else along the way.

I welcome any suggestions on improvement, or requests for clarification/examples on the methodology itself or any of its steps.

## The Steps (Order is not yet refined)

- Identify & Define the problem & what you are trying to achieve.
- Can the problem be broken down into smaller problems?
- Can the sub-problems be broken down further or clarified/rephrased? 
  - <sub>(I find that often, saying the same thing in a different way can shed new light on a problem)</sub>
- What information or examples are available to me about the problem?
- Get examples in front of you! If you can make a visual representation of the problem or part of the problem take the time to do so.(especially when stuck!)
  - <sub> People have a very high degree of spacial intelligence (when someone throws a baseball to you, you probably don't run any complex mathematical calculations in your head, you just catch the ball!) 
  
## Stuck? Hit a wall?
- Ask yourself.
  - Am I sure (this thing) really works the way I think it does?
  - Is there a simple way to test that this thing works the way I think it does?
- Make controlled example cases to troubleshoot parts of your solution. Plug in fake but concrete values to variables and test your logic.
- Get creative!
  - <sub>Would this be easier if the information/data were given to me in reverse? upside down? cut in half?</sub>
- Really really hit a wall?
  -Copy youre code so you have something stable to go back to and break or change parts of logic or values to see what happens!

## Final thoughts and comments.

Problem solving is an iterative process and art. Don't expect your first solution to be perfect and don't get attached to any single solution, allow yourself to be wrong, and flexible in your thinking. It is my opinion that perfect solutions are rare or nonexistent. Great and realistic solutions are the ones that have been weighed measured for their advantages and drawbacks, and most closely fit the real-world context of the given problem.

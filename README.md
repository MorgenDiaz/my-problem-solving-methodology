# my-problem-solving-methodology
An effort and work in progress, to distill my approach to problem solving into repeatable written steps. It occurred to me, while helping fellow programmers create solutions to algorithmic problems; that I had unconsciously developed a way of thinking, favorable to defining and overcoming logical problems. This is an attempt to clarify and refine my own methodology and hopefully help someone else along the way.
